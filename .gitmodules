# Submodules that require authentication are listed with relative paths.
# This makes it so that if a developer can clone partner_tools, they can also
# clone the submodules, even if they only have one of HTTPS or SSH
# authentication set up. Since libpng's Git does not require authentication,
# it does not use a relative path.
